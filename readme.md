## Converting string to camel_case
Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). The next words should be always capitalized.

## Maximum value in nested arrays
Build a function findNestedMaximum that finds the maximum value in an array containing both numbers and nested arrays. The nested arrays themselves can contain both numbers and further nested arrays. Some of the arrays may be empty but at least one number will be present amongst all the arrays.

For example, `findNestedMaximum([4, -3, [10], [[-5, 6], 18]])` should return `18`.

## Multiples of 3 and 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

---

## Reversed Strings
Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.

---

## Sum of positives
You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example `[1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20`

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to `0`.

## Who likes it?
You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.
