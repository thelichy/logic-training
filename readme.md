## Converting string to camel_case
Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). The next words should be always capitalized.

## Count the smiley faces
Given an array (arr) as an argument complete the function countSmileys that should return the total number of smiling faces.

Rules for a smiling face:

Each smiley face must contain a valid pair of eyes. Eyes can be marked as : or ;
A smiley face can have a nose but it does not have to. Valid characters for a nose are - or ~
Every smiling face must have a smiling mouth that should be marked with either ) or D
No additional characters are allowed except for those mentioned.

## Descending order
Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

---

## Is a number prime?
Define a function that takes an integer argument and returns a logical value true or false depending on if the integer is a prime.

Per Wikipedia, a prime number ( or a prime ) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

## Jaden casing
Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

## Maximum value in nested arrays
Build a function findNestedMaximum that finds the maximum value in an array containing both numbers and nested arrays. The nested arrays themselves can contain both numbers and further nested arrays. Some of the arrays may be empty but at least one number will be present amongst all the arrays.

For example, `findNestedMaximum([4, -3, [10], [[-5, 6], 18]])` should return `18`.

## Multiples of 3 and 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

---

## Ones and zeros
Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

---

## Persistent bugger
Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

---

## Reversed Strings
Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.

---

## Stop spinning my words
Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

---

## Strings, strings, strings
After you recovered toString() for booleans, numbers and numerical arrays last time, you now realise that because , you have to be able to convert complex arrays containing any and all data types into strings too!

---

## Sum of positives
You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example `[1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20`

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to `0`.

---

## Weird string case
Write a function that accepts a string, and returns the same string with all even indexed characters in each word upper cased, and all odd indexed characters in each word lower cased. The indexing just explained is zero based, so the zero-ith index is even, therefore that character should be upper cased and you need to start over for each word.

The passed in string will only consist of alphabetical characters and spaces(' '). Spaces will only be present if there are multiple words. Words will be separated by a single space(' ').

## Who likes it?
You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.
